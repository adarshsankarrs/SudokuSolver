# Sudoku Solver
In this project, a model for digit recognition is trained using Deep Learning, and an image of a sudoku puzzle is processed using OpenCV to separate out each cell for prediction. A backtracking approach is then used to solve the extracted values. The user receives the solution mapped on an image of a sudoku template.
